TL;NR: Install the plug-in via github: [Vim-Matlab](https://github.com/lazywei/vim-matlab).

As I use vim daily for everything, I use it for writing Matlab code. However, the default behavior of Vim's Matlab support is not as well as I expected.

Fortunately, I found a [vim plug-in](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21798-editing-matlab-files-in-vim) to improve this. Though this plug-in works pretty well, it isn't in a version control system (e.g. git), which make it hard to maintain and even install. Therefore, I download it and host it on github, you can then install it through any method you like. Personally, I prefer [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).

Vim-Matlab: [repo](https://github.com/lazywei/vim-matlab)

Features:
- Syntax highlighting
- Correct indentation
- Correct setting to use the `matchit.vim` script
- Tag support
- Help file

Again, I don't own these codes. I only copy it and host it on github. If there is any concern, please let me know. Thanks!
